- Public diff: -10113420 (-0.09%)

## Inferred Approach

tightens active-width envelope/margin for the dialog-GCD body; primarily targets peak qubit width rather than raw Toffoli.

## Follow-up Value

- Reuse when exploring: tightens active-width envelope/margin for the dialog-GCD body; primarily targets peak qubit width rather than raw Toffoli.
- Watch for validation-island coupling: if this commit touched reroll or compare knobs, retest after stacking with other route changes.
