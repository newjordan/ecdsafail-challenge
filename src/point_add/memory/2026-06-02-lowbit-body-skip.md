# 2026-06-02 low-bit tobitvector body skip

Route: current dialog-GCD compressed sidecar, odd-u low-bit fastpath enabled.

Worked:

- Extended the odd-u low-bit fastpath from the materialized gated load into the
  measured tobitvector add/sub body.
- In the forward controlled subtract, the reachable branch-swap state has
  `subtrahend[0]=1` and `acc[0]=ctrl`, so bit 0 computes `ctrl - ctrl = 0`
  with no borrow into bit 1.
- In the reverse controlled add, after unshift the low accumulator bit is zero
  and `addend[0]=1`, so bit 0 computes `0 + ctrl` with no carry into bit 1.
- Therefore the lane-0 result can be handled by `CX(ctrl, acc[0])`, and the
  Cuccaro body can start at bit 1 for both materialized add and subtract.
- Co-tuned Fiat-Shamir island: `DIALOG_REROLL=1`,
  `DIALOG_POST_SUB_REROLL=12`.

Validation:

- `cargo build --release --bin build_circuit --bin eval_circuit`
- `TRACE_PEAK=1 TRACE_PHASES=1 ./target/release/build_circuit`
- `./target/release/eval_circuit --note "codex lowbit body skip r1 p12"`
- 9024/9024 shots OK: 0 classical mismatches, 0 phase-garbage batches,
  0 ancilla-garbage batches.

Metrics:

- Average executed Toffoli: 1,745,201
- Peak qubits: 1,571
- Score: 2,741,710,771
- Delta vs `005e17a` (1,746,797 * 1,571): -2,507,316 score points
